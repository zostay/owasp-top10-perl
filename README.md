# OWASP Top 10 in Perl

This is a collection of examples showing poor web application security practices
and examples of how to resolve them. The examples are all provided using PSGI
and Plack.

This was originally created by Sterling Hanenkamp as part of a presentation to
the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop 2011 using the 2010 version of the Open Web
Application Security Project's Top 10 List. I hope to maintain it as an example
of best practice. I provide no warranty that any of these problems or solutions
are actual best practice, but they are an attempt toward it.

If you would like to contribute or find a problem, please let me know using one
of the many possible communication mechanisms available on github.
